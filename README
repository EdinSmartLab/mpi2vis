    HDF to PARAVIEW
-------------------------------------------------------------

new FLUSI code writes HDF5 files, according to the file naming convention

  mask_00100.h5
  ux_00001.h5

this h5 file contains a single 3D field, described by the DATASET (see HDF5) "mask"
it also holds 4 attributes: 

  nxyz = integer(3) domain resolution
  domain_size = double(3) domain size
  time = double time of the snapshot
  epsi = double the penalty parameter
  
the conversion to paraview works as follows:

a) the script hdf2xmf.sh scans all files, and writes vectors ("mask"), scalars ("u") and basenames ("00010") in simple txt files

b) the fortran XMF generator reads these to know what files to process

c) the fortran XMF generator fetches the attributes directly from the *.h5 files. that is all we need to create the XML file.

Note: this is the concept of light and heavy data (www.xdmf.org). The light XML file just tells PARAVIEW what to do with the heavy *.h5 files. YOU NEED BOTH!
