# note:
# * this is not a "true" conversion in the sense that the *.xmf only tells paraview what
#   to do with the *.h5 files. you'll need both!
# * yes, its true! this script is completely automatical and doesn't need arguments
# * note the *.h5 files must contain the attributes "nxyz", "time", "domain_size". also, they must
#   follow the file naming convention: mask_00010.h5 is a valid name. the dataset in the file MUST
#   have the SAME name as the prefix of the file.
